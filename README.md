ToDo List

# HTML
HTMl-Hyper Text Markup Language. 
HTML is not a programing language. Simply we can say that HTML is structure of a webpage. WebPage Designing requires more expertise in terms of the semantic distribution of the parts of your document like Preparing of the content to display, What should be the headings, content under each heading, any lists (ordered or unordered), any tables to show some data, any forms to take some input etc.
We must ensure that we do not mix style with content, e.g. do not use table because it allows to show elements in row or columns, or using b or i tags because they make text bold or italic. These are to be done in CSS.

# CSS
CSS-Cascading Style Sheets
CSS gives a default look and feel to any HTML element that you add. By adding your own CSS you can greatly modify as per your requirements. With the helpof css we can modify the webpages accordingto our needs. We can change position, font, box, behaviour of texts,images weight, font, opacity etc.We have to link the css file in the head section of html.

# JAVASCRIPT
Javascript is used to make your page interactive.It is the only Programming Language for the web. Yes it is actually a programming language as compared to HTML (Markup Language) and CSS (Stylesheet).We have to link the javascript file in the body section of the html

# Objective Of Our Page
